s = "Hello"

# `print(s[1:5])` is printing a substring of the string `s`. The substring starts at index 1
# (inclusive) and ends at index 5 (exclusive), so it will print the characters at indices 1, 2, 3, and
# 4 of the string `s`. In this case, it will print the substring "ello".
print(s[1:5])

# `print(s[1:5:2])` is printing a substring of the string `s` with a step size of 2. The substring
# starts at index 1 (inclusive) and ends at index 5 (exclusive), so it will print the characters at
# indices 1 and 3 of the string `s`. In this case, it will print the substring "el".
print(s[1:5:2])
